# hello-world
Hi, I'm Jessie!

# I'm an almost-thirty year old wife & mom. I have 3 young kiddos, and until December of 2020, I had been a stay at home mom with them since they were born. I like the stars, gardening and hiking. I like coding! I took a intro computer science class my last semester of college and almost changed my major right then lol
# But here I am, and years later the desire/joy hasn't stopped so I decided to really up my game and commit learning to code. In September 2020, I started using MIT Open Courseware to learning CS & Python!
